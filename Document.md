## 1. Overview
This workflow is built with n8n to act as a **chatbot assistant** that receives messages, generates AI-based responses, calls APIs when needed, and updates a Discord channel with the output.

---

## 2. Nodes Explained
1. **Trigger (When Chat Message Received)**  
   - Entry point of the workflow. Listens for incoming messages.

2. **Ollama Chat Model**  
   - Handles text generation. Produces AI-powered answers.

3. **Simple Memory**  
   - Stores conversation context for continuity in chats.

4. **AI Agent**  
   - Acts as a central processor connecting Model, Memory, and Tools.
   - Decides when to use external tools like HTTP Request.

5. **HTTP Request Node**  
   - Example: Fetching external data (weather, crypto prices, etc.)
   - Can be replaced/extended with other APIs.

6. **Discord (Update a Channel)**  
   - Posts chatbot’s response into a chosen Discord channel.

## 3. Use Cases
- **Customer Support** → Automatically answer FAQs and log data to Discord.  
- **Information Fetcher** → Chatbot that fetches real-time info (weather, news, finance).  
- **Team Assistant** → Send AI-generated responses or reminders into Discord/Slack.

## 4. Future Enhancements
- Add conditional logic (e.g., classify messages as FAQ vs. Support Ticket).  
- Log conversations into Google Sheets / Airtable for analytics.  
- Add multi-channel support (Slack, Telegram).
