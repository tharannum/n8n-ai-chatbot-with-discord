# ðŸ¤– AI Chatbot Workflow with n8n (Demo)

This repository contains a **demo chatbot workflow** built using [n8n](https://n8n.io/).  
The workflow demonstrates how to integrate **AI models, memory, external APIs, and messaging tools** inside an automation pipeline.  

Even though this is a **demo version** (not fully configured with API keys/tokens), it highlights my ability to:  
- Design automation workflows  
- Connect multiple services (AI, APIs, Discord)  
- Showcase real-world chatbot architecture
